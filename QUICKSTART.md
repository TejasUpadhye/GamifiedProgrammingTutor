## 🎓 Learning Path

If you're **completely new to coding**, here's the order:

1. **Variables** - Learn to store information
2. **Conditions** - Learn to make decisions
3. **Loops** - Learn to repeat actions
4. **Functions** - Learn to reuse code
5. **Arrays** - Learn to handle collections
6. **OOP** - Learn to organize complex code

## 📝 Example Solutions

### Variables - Challenge 1
```javascript
let crystalPower = 100;
```

### Conditions - Challenge 1
```javascript
let courage = 75;
let gateOpen = false;

if (courage > 50) {
    gateOpen = true;
}
```

### Loops - Challenge 1
```javascript
let echoCount = 0;

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    echoCount++;
}
```

### Functions - Challenge 1
```javascript
function awaken() {
    return "Giant awakens!";
}
```

### Arrays - Challenge 1
```javascript
let serpents = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

### OOP - Challenge 1
```javascript
class Warrior {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

let hero = new Warrior("Aragorn");
```

## 🎮 Quick Start Example

```javascript
// Your first challenge in the Realm of Variables:
let crystalPower = 100;

// As you progress, challenges become more complex:
function awakenGiant(size) {
    return size > 50 ? "Giant awakens!" : "Too weak...";
}

// Until you master object-oriented programming:
class Kingdom {
    constructor() {
        this.citizens = [];
    }
    addCitizen(citizen) {
        this.citizens.push(citizen);
    }
}
```
